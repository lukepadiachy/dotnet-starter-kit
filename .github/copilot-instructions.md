## Guidelines
- Direct users to the appropriate markdown files within the repository for detailed instructions.
- Ensure that all information is up-to-date and reflects the latest stable versions of .NET technologies.
- Avoid introducing external tools or libraries unless they are essential to the task at hand.
- When explaining commands or code, provide context and explain their purpose.
- Maintain consistency in formatting and structure across all documentation.
- If a user asks a question, point them to the appropriate MD file and optionally quote or summarize a snippet.
