## 1. Find the Latest .NET Version

The .NET team regularly releases new versions. To ensure you install the latest stable version:
- Visit the [official .NET download page](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet).
- The page will highlight the latest version at the top (for example, ".NET 9" or newer).
- Choose the SDK for your platform (Windows, Linux, or macOS).

**Tip:** Always use the version marked as "Recommended" or "LTS" (Long Term Support) unless you have a specific need for a preview or older version.

## 2. Check System Requirements

Before installing, make sure your machine meets the requirements for the .NET version you want to install. You can find detailed requirements for each OS here:
- [Windows requirements](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/install/windows#supported-versions)
- [macOS requirements](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/install/macos#supported-versions)
- [Linux requirements](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/install/linux#supported-versions)

**How to check your system:**
- **Windows:**
  - Open PowerShell and run:
    ```powershell
    systeminfo
    ```
    This will show your OS version, architecture, and more.
- **macOS:**
  - Open Terminal and run:
    ```bash
    sw_vers
    uname -m
    ```
    This will show your macOS version and CPU architecture.
- **Linux:**
  - Open Terminal and run:
    ```bash
    uname -a
    lsb_release -a  # (if available)
    ```
    This will show your distribution, version, and architecture.

If your OS or hardware is not listed in the official requirements, .NET may not be supported.
